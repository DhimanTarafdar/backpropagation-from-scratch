# Backpropagation From Scratch
This repository contains a step-by-step manual implementation of the Backpropagation algorithm for both Regression and Classification tasks. The goal of this repositories is to demonstrate the underlying mathematics of Neural Networks without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
